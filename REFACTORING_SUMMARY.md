- `handleRemoveAssaultObjective()`, etc.: Objective removal
- `clearAllObjectives()`: Clear all objectives

### 10. `src/hooks/useUpgradeManagement.ts` (~400 lines)
**Purpose**: Complex upgrade logic
**Functions**:
- `handleAddUpgrade()`: Add upgrades to ships
- `handleSelectUpgrade()`: Upgrade selection with slot management
- `handleRemoveUpgrade()`: Remove upgrades with dependency handling
- Complex state management for disabled/enabled/grey upgrades and filled slots

### 11. `src/components/FleetBuilderRefactored.tsx` (~615 lines)
**Purpose**: Demonstration of modular component
**Status**: ⚠️ **Partially Complete** - Has type errors that need resolution
**Features**:
- Uses all custom hooks
- Cleaner UI-focused structure
- Consolidated state management
- All import/export functionality
- Print functionality

## Issues to Resolve

### Current TypeScript Errors in FleetBuilderRefactored.tsx:
1. **Hook parameter mismatches**: Some hooks expect different parameters than being passed
2. **Property access errors**: Trying to access properties that don't exist on hook return types
3. **Function signature mismatches**: Some function calls have wrong parameter counts/types

### Root Cause:
The hooks were designed to work independently with their own state, but the refactored component assumes they share state with `useFleetState`. Need to either:
1. **Option A**: Modify hooks to work with shared state
2. **Option B**: Update component to coordinate between independent hook states
3. **Option C**: Create a higher-level state management pattern

## Architecture Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Data Layer**: Utils handle data fetching and processing
- **Business Logic**: Hooks encapsulate domain logic
- **UI Layer**: Component focuses on rendering and user interaction

### 2. **Testability**
- Pure functions in utils are easily unit tested
- Hooks can be tested in isolation
- UI logic separated from business logic

### 3. **Reusability**
- Hooks can be reused across different components
- Utils can be imported anywhere
- Types ensure consistency

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Clear file boundaries with single responsibilities
- Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
- Reduced cognitive load per file

### 5. **Performance Opportunities**
- Hooks can be optimized independently
- Selective re-renders based on specific state changes
- Better memoization possibilities

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅ **COMPLETE**
- Create type definitions
- Extract utility functions
- Build core data operations

### Phase 2: Business Logic ✅ **COMPLETE**
- Create custom hooks for major domains
- Implement state management patterns
- Handle complex business rules

### Phase 3: Component Integration ⚠️ **IN PROGRESS**
- **Current Status**: Component created but has TypeScript errors
- **Next Steps**: 
  1. Resolve hook integration issues
  2. Fix type mismatches
  3. Test full functionality
  4. Ensure feature parity with original

### Phase 4: Migration **PENDING**
- Replace original FleetBuilder with refactored version
- Update imports across codebase
- Remove old component
- Performance testing and optimization

## Metrics

| Metric | Original | Refactored | Improvement |
|--------|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Lines of Code** | 3,721 | ~1,750 | 53% reduction |
| **Files** | 1 | 9 | Better organization |
| **Largest File** | 3,721 lines | 615 lines | 83% reduction |
| **Average File Size** | 3,721 lines | 194 lines | 95% reduction |
| **Testable Units** | Monolithic | 50+ functions | Significantly improved |

## Technical Debt Resolved

1. **Massive Function Size**: Broke down into focused, single-purpose functions
2. **State Complexity**: Separated concerns into domain-specific hooks
3. **Difficult Testing**: Created testable units with clear interfaces
4. **Hard to Modify**: Clear boundaries make changes safer and easier
5. **Performance Issues**: Better optimization opportunities through selective updates

## Next Steps for Completion

1. **Resolve TypeScript Errors**: Fix the hook integration issues in FleetBuilderRefactored.tsx
2. **Test Feature Parity**: Ensure all original functionality works
3. **Performance Testing**: Verify no regressions
4. **Integration Testing**: Test with existing components
5. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation for hooks
6. **Migration**: Replace original component

## Conclusion

The refactoring has successfully created a solid foundation with well-separated concerns, significantly improved maintainability, and better testing opportunities. The main remaining work is resolving the integration issues in the demonstration component and completing the migration.

The architecture demonstrates clear benefits:
- **53% reduction in total code**
- **83% reduction in largest file size**
- **Better separation of concerns**
- **Improved testability**
- **Enhanced reusability**

Once the TypeScript integration issues are resolved, this refactored architecture will provide a much more maintainable and scalable codebase for the fleet builder functionality.
