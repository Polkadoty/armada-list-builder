## What is Star Forge?

Star Forge is a web application designed to help players of Star Wars: Armada create and manage their fleets.

## How do I use the Fleet Builder?

1. Select your faction
2. Add ships and squadrons to your fleet
3. Customize your ships with upgrades
4. Keep an eye on your total fleet points

## Is this an official Star Wars: Armada application?

No, this is a fan-made project and is not officially associated with Star Wars: Armada or its publishers.

## How often is the data updated?

I strive to keep the data up-to-date with the latest releases and errata. Current content is being uploaded into the API, and I have functionality for user-generated content.

## I found a bug or have a suggestion. How can I report it?

Please visit my GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/Polkadoty/armada-list-builder) and open an issue. I appreciate your feedback!

## Is my fleet data saved?

Yes. Your fleet data is saved in your browser's local storage. You can export your fleet as text for safe-keeping. Login functionality currently works :)
